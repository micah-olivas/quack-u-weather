The Quack-u-weather web app serves as a front end for a regression predictive model of waterfowl migration in Central California wetlands. A gradient-boosted machine (GBM via Caret package in R) was trained on 12 meteorological predictors from more than 390 observations of daily birdwatching at a wetlands preserve in Wasco, CA. The webapp displays a five-day forecast of modelâ€“predicted waterfowl density based on local weather forecasts courtesy of Weather Underground.
